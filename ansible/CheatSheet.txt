# Ansible tutorial cheat sheet

syntax: ansible <target*> <module> <args/options>
*target - could be a single machine or a groupd of machines


ansible 192.168.122.208 -m ping -i inventory -u root
ansible 192.168.122.208 -raw "ls -alh" -i inventory -u root -k
ansible workers -raw "zypper lr -puU" -i inventory -u root

#useful to make mistakes 
ansible all -m ping -a "blah" -i inventory -u root

#run a script on remote machine(s)
ansible 192.168.122.208 -m script -a "script.sh" -u root -i inventory

#if you want to not indicate -i inventory file - set your inventory in /etc/ansible/config

#more complicated stuff
